## üöÄ Abstract
Illusory Environment explores the relationship and the boundaries between physical and virtual reality by using the paradox as a tool to bend the perception of presence. In a simple term, we are altering the perception of the environment using illusion. Challenging our perception of the rudiment ordinance of gravity, time, scale, space, and form to investigate other possible interactions in the virtual environment.

## ‚ú® Motivation
How VR application use ‚Äúvisual‚Äù illusion from video game and films as a tool behind in regular intraction.

#### Step 1: Element combinations
In the first step, we think about basic elements that we can bend and twist in VR, such as:
1. Gravity
2. Time
3. Scale
4. Direction
5. Space
6. Form
#### Step 2: Illusion
After having different elements, we made different combinations to create different illusions
| Illusion   | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Space Loop | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/space%20loop.gif) |
| Space Switch | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/4Rooms.gif) ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/space%20switch.gif) |
| Passage Switch | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/Portal.gif) ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/Portal_2.gif)|
| Gravity | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/Gravity.gif) ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/Gravity_2.gif) |

| Picture Frame | __Still work in progress. Stay tuned!__ |
| Scale | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/scale_1.gif) |
| Projection | ![image](https://github.com/Xiaobai-Ji/Illusive-Reality/blob/main/gif/projection_1.gif) |

#### Step 3: Vocabulary

#### Step 4: Application

| Illusion   | Characteristics | Applications |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Space Loop | - Visit unlimited space in confined physical space | - In-home museum/gallery visit |
| Space Switch |   |   |
| Passage Switch | - Move user to another space instantly | - Unlimitedly expand space in XR |
| Gravity | - Move things around that are beyond my control | - Grab remote objects <br /> - Reach objects far away in XR for disabled |
| The God Mode | - Build the scene in VR directly | - VR architect in VR rather than in Unity |
| Picture Frame | - Build and combine scene in XR | - Modify the environment |
| Scale |   | - Scale myself and move extremely fast to another VR space |
| Projection |   |  |


## ü™ú Final design
### 1. Scene style

### 2. Wireframing + logics

### 3. Scene plan

## ü´† Discussion
- The chasm between designers and developers
- How can we reach more people regarding illusion design

## üëã Contribution
- Developed illusions in VR, challenged current game engine design by developing non-Euclidean space
- Illusion design packages and tutorials
- Potential applications of illusions
- Un-illusionalizing: Illusions might become useful and so common in the future that it becomes ordinary and standard in VR, just like we are used to elevators and stairs in the reality. In a sense, we are non-illusionalizing illusions.
